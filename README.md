Tools- Google colab and Python
Theory- This repository covers fundamental Python concepts demonstrated through basic programs such as printing output, taking user input, using conditional statements, performing arithmetic operations, and working with built-in data types.

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamically typed programming language. Programs are executed line by line using the Python interpreter. The print() function is used to display output on the screen. By default, each print statement moves the cursor to a new line, but this behavior can be controlled using the end parameter. Python also allows multiple statements on one line separated by semicolons, although writing one statement per line is considered best practice. Python is case-sensitive, so variables like a and A are treated as different identifiers.

The programs demonstrate variable assignment and multiple variable initialization in a single statement. Python automatically assigns data types at runtime. Common built-in data types used include integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), boolean values (bool), and complex numbers (complex). The type() function is used to identify the data type of variables.

User interaction is handled using the input() function. Since input is received as a string by default, explicit type conversion using int() or float() is required for numerical calculations. Conditional statements such as if, elif, and else are used to implement decision-making logic, as shown in examples like a simple calculator, marks calculation, and area calculation programs.

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations. These examples illustrate how Python can be applied to solve real-world problems such as computing averages and calculating areas. The repository also introduces the tuple data type, which is an ordered and immutable collection, and demonstrates tuple concatenation using the + operator.

Overall, this repository provides a practical introduction to Python programming, covering core concepts like output formatting, variables, data types, user input, type casting, conditional logic, arithmetic operations, and basic data structures.
